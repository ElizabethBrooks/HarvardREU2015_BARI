When you can't talk to the one person who gets you better than anybody 
“<HANDLE> I can't even look at The Internet on days like today. People are awful.”
I miss the old you..  the old us..
There are so many things i want to say and text message just doesn't do them justice
the akward moment when there is a really cute guy in the machine next to you... and your sweating and panting like a freak. #thegymstruggles
All i can tell myself is try to be strong.

I'm trying to go home ...
“<HANDLE>: I feel I'm standing in the middle of a crowded room, screaming at the top of my lungs, and no one even looks up.”
I feel like i havent had human contact in a while

“<HANDLE>: Sucks putting so much effort into that one person  getting nothing in return .”
I wish I had a girlfriend like Lilly
A walk around the campus paying tribute and showing support to all those affected by the tragedy… 
I have a lot of pride for where I live,  often gloat about it. Today Im sickened by what happened. Please remember to tell people you care.
