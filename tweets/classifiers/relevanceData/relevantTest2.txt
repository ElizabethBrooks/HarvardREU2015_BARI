<HANDLE> some idiot left his backpack inside one of those newspaper boxes in front of Taranta. Turned out to be nothing.
<HANDLE> thanks. I am safe. Lots of police.
If you're going to escape in a boat, make sure it's in water, not Watertown.
<HANDLE> yes that's right!! One brother dead, other on the loose. All surrounding cities are on lockdown
 MBTA Copley Station remains closed today

Ohhh, here goes the confusion again.  <HANDLE>: WHDH is no longer reporting one Watertown suspect dead. 
#RIP to the victims of the #bostonmarathon bombing like this 8 year old boy who's holding a poster \u2026

Family members embracing on #KrystleCampbell 's porch in #Medford. #bostonmarathon #prayforboston 
<HANDLE> I seen that, but how is NY reporting boston news before boston...In Boston?
<HANDLE> ohhh I see . I fell asleep before everything happened  woke up at 5 when I heard it on the radio now I'm mad scared
