# This portion of the program builds the data list, organized by month, in a list called emergency. It runs through the list, pulling dates from the csv file, and then counts the number of times any particular month (and thereby the amount of calls in that month) comes up. If a month has not previously been encountered, it is added to the list and given a count of one. Otherwise, it's incremented by one.
